  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Corrected: Subtracts from container's available space*/
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensures padding and border are included in width calculation */
}
/*The box-sizing property is crucial here. Without it, the padding and border would be added to the width, making the subtraction inaccurate. By setting box-sizing to border-box, the padding and border are included in the element's total width, allowing the calc() function to work correctly. */
